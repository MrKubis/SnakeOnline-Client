Sup!!!
This project's purpose is to handle web client for my Online Snake Game, it's quite basic, just tui with web socket client but it was my first GO project. Quite fun!

## Requirements
- [go 1.25.7](https://go.dev/doc/go1.25)
- [Working snake server](https://github.com/MrKubis/SnakeOnline-Server)

## Install
To install the project fetch this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/MrKubis/SnakeOnline-Client.git
```
In the project directory install the project as:
```
go build -o snake ./cmd
```
## How it works?
The client connects to the server via WebSocket connection. You can set up your own server and play with your friends ^^

Enjoy!
